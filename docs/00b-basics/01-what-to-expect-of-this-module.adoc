=== What does the module “{curriculum-short}” convey?

Embedded systems are computer systems that are integrated in a larger
cyber-physical system, via which they interact with the physical environment
through sensors and actuators. As the requirements concerning the functionality
and the quality characteristics of these systems are increasing, the size and
the complexity of embedded systems software grows considerably.

In domains such as automotive systems, automation, rail, or medical devices for
treatment or diagnostics, particular quality characteristics need to be
achieved:

* systems must be highly reliable and are often safety-critical

* systems must react to events in their environment in a timely, predictable way,
  leading to hard real-time requirements

* systems need to be adaptable to quickly react to changing market requirements

The module “{curriculum-short}” conveys a methodical approach to architecture
design for dependable embedded systems. It shows how software architecture
interacts with the overall systems architecture, and how the requirements with
regards to safety, dependability, real time and adaptability are addressed in a
systematic way. In addition to patterns and solution concepts for designing
appropriate software architectures, the module also addresses the analysis of
software architectures with regard to the required quality characteristics.
