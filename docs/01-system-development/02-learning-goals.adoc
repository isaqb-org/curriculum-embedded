[[LG-1-1]]
==== LG 1-1: Understand the systematic approach to systems development

* Participants understand the cross-cutting nature of aspects like time
  behavior, reliability and safety with regards to system-, software- and
  hardware-develoment, and the necessity to address these with an integrated
  systems development approach.

* Participants understand that systems development follows an iterative approach
  that includes both top-down activities like working with models, estimations
  and simulations, and bottom-up activities like tests and measurements on real
  systems to validate the estimations and simulations.

* Participants understand that modeling and model-based analysis enable the
  evaluation of different architectures in a cost-efficient way. Model-based
  approaches therefore enable a more thorough exploration of the design space.

* Participants understand the costs and benefits of developing and maintaining
  multiple architectural abstraction levels, such as functional and technical
  system architectures: A functional architecture enables reasoning about a
  system in a way that is independent of a specific technical realization and
  allows for different technical variants. These benefits need to be weighed
  against the costs for developing and maintaining several architectural
  models.

* Participants know methods and frameworks for model-based system development,
  such as Harmony, SYSMOD, and FAS.

* Participants understand that development approaches for embedded systems are
  often subject to domain specific standards.


[[LG-1-2]]
==== LG 1-2: Modelling and analysis of functional architectures

Participants can apply a systematic approach to modelling and analysis of
functional architectures:

* Model the system context with external systems, physical entities, users of
  the system and the logical events that occur between the system and its
  environment

* Hierarchically decompose the system from a purely functional perspective,
  identifying function blocks and their interactions via events or information
  flows

* Define event chains based on the functional architecture. An event chain
  traces the end to end behavior from an external triggering event to the
  desired system reaction through the involved function blocks, events and
  information flows.

Participants understand that a functional architecture enables reasoning about
system quality characteristics at an abstract level, e.g. regarding time behavior,
reliability, or flexibility.

Participants know examples how functional architectures can be modelled,
e.g. with SysML.


[[LG-1-3]]
==== LG 1-3: Modelling and analysis of technical system architectures

Participants understand the systematic approach to modelling and analysis of
technical system architectures:

* Analyze the impact factors, like quality requirements, organizational
  constraints, technological constraints, as defined in the CPSA Foundation
  Level curriculum. For the technical system architecture of embedded systems,
  impact factors are often related to dependability and safety requirements,
  performance and real-time requirements, flexibility  requirements and support
  for different product variants and product lines. Examples for further
  considerations are physical proximity to sensors and actuators, limited
  construction space, connectivity requirements, hardware cost, or development
  schedules.

* Based on the impact factors analysis, identify architectural issues and
  solution strategies

* Evaluate alternative technical system architectures, and select a technical
  system architecture for further refinement

Participants understand that the design of a technical system architecture is an
iterative process that requires feedback from software development and hardware
development.

Participants know typical decisions that need to be made in the design of the
technical system architecture:

* Allocation of function blocks to one or more control units, considering
  e.g. performance and isolation requirements

* Deciding the number of control units and their hardware characteristics
  (e.g. single core, homogeneous multi core, heterogeneous multi core, amount of
  RAM, ROM, NVRAM, peripherals like sensors and actuators, custom hardware)

* Decide on the communication paradigm (e.g. time triggered vs. event triggered)

* Decide on network topologies (e.g. bus vs. star) and network technologies,
  both wired (e.g. ethernet, flexray, CAN), and wireless (e.g. Bluetooth, WiFi,
  cellular)

* Understand the challenges of distributed systems regarding latency,
  throughput, lack of a global clock
